## Product Vision Statement

Your personal journal for NYC’s best Asian eats - dish by dish, and not just place by place.

## User Requirements

1. As a Curator, I want to search for specific dishes (e.g., "Pad See Ew") rather than just restaurant names so that I can find the best version of my favorite specific dishes.
2. As a Curator, I want to filter restaurants by specific regional cuisines (e.g., "Szechuan" instead of "Chinese") so that I can find authentic food rather than generic options where I might not like all the options part of the generic cuisine.
3. As a Curator, I want to rate individual menu items separately from the restaurant so that I remember specifically what was good and what to avoid next time.
4. As a Curator, I want to upload photos of my meal directly to my review so that I have a visual memory of the experience.
5. As a Curator, I want to add additional text notes to my logs so that I can look over them when deciding where to go eat next.
6. As a Curator, I want to share a direct link to my reviews with friends via text so that I don't have to copy-paste a list every time someone wants to see my reviews.
7. As a Curator, I want to view a map of highly-rated spots of a specific dish and/or specific cuisine near my current location so that I can quickly decide where to eat when I am walking around the city.
8. As a Curator, I want to see a chronological history of everywhere I have eaten so that I can retrace my eating history in the past.
9. As a Curator, I want to assign a specific "Spice Level" rating to a dish so that I can track which spots serve dishes with spiciness closer to levels I prefer.
10. As a Curator, I want to edit my past reviews so that I can update my rating if a dish's quality at a restaurant changes over time.
